## 1. Introduction: What We're Building

We're going to build a modern, responsive portfolio website. This site will showcase your projects, skills, and experience. We'll use a popular and powerful tech stack:

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Think of it as the framework that helps us create interactive components on the page.
*   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. This helps catch errors early and makes our code more robust and easier to understand.
*   **Vite:** A blazing-fast build tool and development server. It makes starting and running our project incredibly quick.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows us to style our components directly in the HTML/JSX. It's like having a set of LEGO bricks for styling.
*   **Shadcn/ui:** A collection of beautifully designed, accessible UI components that we can easily integrate into our project. These are pre-built components like buttons, cards, dialogs, etc., that save us a lot of time.

Our project structure will live inside a `frontend` directory.

## 2. Prerequisites: Tools of the Trade

Before we start coding, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. Node.js comes with `npm` (Node Package Manager), which we'll use to manage our project's dependencies (libraries and tools).

*   You can download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version is recommended).

You don't need to globally install Vite or TypeScript (`npm install -g vite typescript`) as we'll use `npx` to run the latest versions when needed.

## 3. Project Setup: Laying the Foundation

Alright, let's create our project!

1.  **Create the Project Directory:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to where you want to create your project. Let's say `Desktop`.
    ```bash
    cd Desktop
    mkdir test_portfolio
    cd test_portfolio
    ```

2.  **Initialize a Vite + React + TypeScript Project:**
    We'll create our actual project in a subdirectory called `frontend`.
    ```bash
    # This command creates a new Vite project named 'frontend' using the react-ts template
    npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react-ts
    ```
    Follow the prompts if any. This will set up a basic React and TypeScript project for us.

3.  **Navigate into Your Project:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
    From now on, unless specified, all commands should be run from the `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend` directory.

4.  **Install Initial Dependencies:**
    Vite sets up React, but we need more tools for our full-fledged portfolio.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command installs the basic dependencies listed in the `package.json` created by Vite.

5.  **Install Project-Specific Dependencies:**
    These are the libraries our portfolio will use:
    ```bash
    npm install react-router-dom class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge tailwindcss-animate lucide-react framer-motion recharts react-hot-toast @radix-ui/react-accordion @radix-ui/react-alert-dialog @radix-ui/react-avatar @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu @radix-ui/react-label @radix-ui/react-popover @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-separator @radix-ui/react-slider @radix-ui/react-slot @radix-ui/react-switch @radix-ui/react-tabs @radix-ui/react-tooltip
    ```
    *   `react-router-dom`: For handling navigation between different pages in our app.
    *   `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`: Utilities for working with Tailwind CSS, especially for creating reusable and configurable components. `cn` function in `shadcn/ui` uses these.
    *   `tailwindcss-animate`: Adds animation utilities for Tailwind CSS.
    *   `lucide-react`: A beautiful library of icons we can use.
    *   `framer-motion`: For creating smooth animations.
    *   `recharts`: For creating charts (if you plan to visualize data).
    *   `react-hot-toast`: For displaying notifications.
    *   `@radix-ui/*`: These are headless (unstyled but functional) UI primitives that `shadcn/ui` components are built upon. They provide accessibility and behavior out of the box.

6.  **Install Development Dependencies:**
    These are tools that help us during development but aren't part of the final website code that users see.
    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer @types/node
    ```
    *   `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer`: Essential for using Tailwind CSS. PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins, and Autoprefixer adds vendor prefixes (like `-webkit-` or `-moz-`) to CSS rules.
    *   `@types/node`: Provides TypeScript type definitions for Node.js, useful for configuration files like `vite.config.ts`.

    Your `package.json` file will now list all these packages. It's like the ingredient list for our project!

## 4. Configuration Deep Dive: Tailoring Our Project

With our project created and dependencies installed, it's time to configure everything. This part is crucial, like tuning an instrument before a performance.

### TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`)

TypeScript helps us write safer JavaScript. The `tsconfig.json` file tells the TypeScript compiler how to check our code. Vite creates a basic one, but we'll enhance it for our needs, especially for using path aliases (like `@/*` to refer to `src/*`).

Make sure your `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\tsconfig.json` looks like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020", // Specifies the JavaScript version the compiler outputs
    "useDefineForClassFields": true, // Standard for modern class fields
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"], // Core libraries available
    "module": "ESNext", // Modern module system
    "skipLibCheck": true, // Skips type checking of declaration files (speeds up compilation)

    /* Bundler mode */
    "moduleResolution": "bundler", // How TypeScript finds modules, aligns with Vite
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true, // Allows importing .ts files with .ts extension (not usually needed)
    "resolveJsonModule": true, // Allows importing .json files
    "isolatedModules": true, // Ensures each file can be compiled independently
    "noEmit": true, // TypeScript won't output JS files; Vite handles this
    "jsx": "react-jsx", // Use the new JSX transform

    /* Linting */
    "strict": true, // Enables all strict type-checking options
    "noUnusedLocals": true, // Reports unused local variables
    "noUnusedParameters": true, // Reports unused function parameters
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true, // Prevents fallthrough bugs in switch statements

    /* Path Aliases */
    "baseUrl": ".", // Base directory for resolving non-absolute module names
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"] // Allows us to write import "@/components/Button" instead of "../../components/Button"
    }
  },
  "include": ["src", "vite.config.ts", "tailwind.config.ts", "postcss.config.cjs"], // Files TypeScript should check
  "references": [{ "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" }] // Link to another tsconfig for Node.js specific parts (like vite.config.ts)
}
```

**Teacher's Tip:** Path aliases like `@/*` are super handy! They make your import statements cleaner and easier to manage, especially in larger projects.

### Vite (`vite.config.ts`)

Vite is our build tool. Its configuration file, `vite.config.ts`, tells Vite how to build and serve our project. We need to set up the React plugin and our path alias.

Ensure your `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\vite.config.ts` looks like this:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import path from 'path' // Node.js 'path' module for working with file paths

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()], // The React plugin enables React-specific features like JSX transformation
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      // This sets up the '@' alias to point to the 'src' directory
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"), 
    }
  },
  // Optional: If you're using Docker or WSL, sometimes this helps with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
  // server: {
  //   host: true, 
  //   watch: {
  //     usePolling: true
  //   }
  // }
})
```

**Explanation:**
*   `@vitejs/plugin-react`: This plugin enables Fast Refresh (also known as Hot Module Replacement - HMR) for React components, meaning changes in your code appear in the browser almost instantly without a full page reload.
*   `resolve.alias`: This is where we define our `@` alias. `__dirname` is a Node.js variable that gives the directory of the current file (`vite.config.ts`), and `path.resolve` creates an absolute path to `src`.

### Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.cjs`, `src/index.css`)

Tailwind CSS is our styling workhorse.

1.  **Initialize Tailwind CSS:**
    If you haven't already, run this command in your `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```
    This creates two files:
    *   `tailwind.config.js` (or `.ts` if you prefer, we'll use `.ts`)
    *   `postcss.config.js` (or `.cjs`)

    Let's ensure they are named `tailwind.config.ts` and `postcss.config.cjs`. Rename if necessary.

2.  **Configure `tailwind.config.ts`:**
    This file is where you customize Tailwind, like defining your color palette, fonts, or extending its utility classes.
    Update `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\tailwind.config.ts` to:

    ```typescript
    import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'
    import tailwindcssAnimate from 'tailwindcss-animate' // Import the plugin

    export default {
      darkMode: ["class"], // Enables dark mode based on a 'dark' class on the html tag
      content: [
        "./index.html", // Vite's entry HTML file
        "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", // All JavaScript/TypeScript files in the src folder
      ],
      prefix: "", // No prefix for Tailwind classes (e.g., 'text-blue-500' not 'tw-text-blue-500')
      theme: {
        container: { // Customizations for the 'container' class
          center: true, // Centers the container
          padding: "2rem", // Default padding
          screens: { // Breakpoints for responsive design
            "2xl": "1400px", // Max width for extra-large screens
          },
        },
        extend: { // Here you can add your custom styles or override Tailwind's defaults
          colors: { // Example: define custom colors for your brand
            // brand: {
            //   primary: '#1E40AF',
            //   secondary: '#BEF264',
            // }
          },
          fontFamily: { // Example: define custom fonts
            // sans: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'], 
          },
          // Shadcn/ui often adds its color variables here during setup.
          // For example:
          // border: "hsl(var(--border))",
          // input: "hsl(var(--input))",
          // ring: "hsl(var(--ring))",
          // background: "hsl(var(--background))",
          // foreground: "hsl(var(--foreground))",
          // ... and many more
        },
      },
      plugins: [
        tailwindcssAnimate // Enables animation utilities
      ],
    } satisfies Config
    ```
    **Teacher's Tip:** The `content` array is crucial! It tells Tailwind CSS which files to scan for class names. If you use a class in your code and it's not working, check this array first!

3.  **Configure `postcss.config.cjs`:**
    PostCSS helps Tailwind do its magic.
    Ensure `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\postcss.config.cjs` contains:
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      plugins: {
        tailwindcss: {}, // The Tailwind CSS plugin
        autoprefixer: {}, // The Autoprefixer plugin (adds vendor prefixes)
      },
    };
    ```

4.  **Import Tailwind Styles in `src/index.css`:**
    Vite should have created an `src/index.css` file. Replace its content with the following Tailwind directives. These inject Tailwind's base styles, component classes, and utility classes into your CSS.
    Open `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\src\\index.css` and set its content to:

    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;

    /* 
      This is where shadcn/ui will typically add CSS variables for theming 
      when you initialize it or add components. 
      It will look something like this:
    */
    @layer base {
      :root {
        --background: 0 0% 100%; /* Light mode background */
        --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%; /* Light mode text */

        --card: 0 0% 100%;
        --card-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    
        /* ... many other color variables for primary, secondary, destructive, etc. */
        
        --radius: 0.5rem; /* Default border radius for components */
      }
    
      .dark { /* Variables for dark mode */
        --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
        --foreground: 210 40% 98%;

        --card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
        --card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;

        /* ... many other color variables for dark mode ... */

        --radius: 0.5rem;
      }
    }
    
    @layer base {
      * {
        @apply border-border; /* Applies a default border color (defined by --border variable) */
      }
      body {
        @apply bg-background text-foreground; /* Applies background and text colors from variables */
        font-feature-settings: "rlig" 1, "calt" 1; /* Improves font rendering */
      }
    }
    ```
    **Explanation:**
    *   `@tailwind base;`: Injects Tailwind's reset styles and base element styles.
    *   `@tailwind components;`: Injects Tailwind's component classes (like `container`).
    *   `@tailwind utilities;`: Injects Tailwind's vast library of utility classes (like `text-center`, `p-4`, `bg-blue-500`).
    *   `@layer base { ... }`: This is where we define CSS custom properties (variables) for our theme (colors, border radius, etc.). Shadcn/ui relies heavily on these for consistent styling. The `.dark { ... }` block defines the variables for dark mode.

### Shadcn/ui (`components.json`)

Shadcn/ui isn't a traditional component library you install via npm. Instead, you copy-paste (or use its CLI to add) individual components into your project. This gives you full control over their code. To use the CLI, we need a `components.json` file.

1.  **Create `components.json`:**
    In the root of your `frontend` directory (`c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend`), create a file named `components.json` with the following content:

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
      "style": "default",
      "rsc": false,
      "tsx": true,
      "tailwind": {
        "config": "tailwind.config.ts",
        "css": "src/index.css",
        "baseColor": "slate", 
        "cssVariables": true,
        "prefix": ""
      },
      "aliases": {
        "components": "@/components",
        "utils": "@/lib/utils"
      }
    }
    ```
    **Explanation:**
    *   `style`: The visual style of components (e.g., "default" or "new-york").
    *   `rsc`: Set to `false` as we are not using React Server Components.
    *   `tsx`: Indicates we're using TypeScript.
    *   `tailwind`: Configures how shadcn/ui interacts with your Tailwind setup.
        *   `config`: Path to your Tailwind config file.
        *   `css`: Path to your global CSS file where shadcn/ui will write CSS variables.
        *   `baseColor`: The base color palette shadcn/ui will use for generating shades. "Slate" is a common default.
        *   `cssVariables`: Tells shadcn/ui to use CSS variables for theming (highly recommended!).
    *   `aliases`: Matches the path aliases we set up in `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts`. This tells shadcn/ui where to place components (`@/components/ui`) and utility functions (`@/lib/utils.ts`).

2.  **Initialize Shadcn/ui (Optional but Recommended for CSS Variables):**
    You can run the init command to let shadcn/ui set up some base configurations, especially writing the CSS variables to your `src/index.css`.
    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ui@latest init
    ```
    Follow the prompts. It will ask you about your setup, much of which is already in `components.json`. This step is great for ensuring your `src/index.css` gets populated with the necessary theme variables.

## 5. Core Structure: `main.tsx` and `App.tsx`

Now that our project is configured, let's look at the two most fundamental files in our React application: `src/main.tsx` and `src/App.tsx`. These were created by Vite, but understanding their role is key.

### `src/main.tsx`: The Entry Point

Think of `main.tsx` as the very first door your browser walks through when it loads your website. Its primary job is to take your main React component (which is usually `<App />`) and tell React to render it into a specific spot in your `index.html` file.

Here’s what `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\src\\main.tsx` should look like:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client' // This is React's library for interacting with the DOM (your webpage)
import App from './App.tsx' // Importing our main App component
import './index.css' // Importing our global styles (including Tailwind)

// This is the magic line!
// 1. `document.getElementById('root')`: Finds an HTML element with the ID 'root'.
//    (If you open `frontend/index.html`, you'll see `<div id="root"></div>`)
// 2. `ReactDOM.createRoot(...)`: Creates a React "root" for this element, making it a React-managed area.
// 3. `.render(...)`: Tells React to draw (render) whatever is inside the parentheses into that root.
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

**Teacher's Tip:**
*   `React.StrictMode`: This is a helper component from React that doesn't render any visible UI. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants, helping you catch potential problems in your application early during development. It's good practice to keep it.
*   The `!` after `document.getElementById('root')`: This is TypeScript's non-null assertion operator. It tells TypeScript, "I am sure that `document.getElementById('root')` will not be null here." We can be sure because we know our `index.html` has a `div` with `id="root"`.

### `src/App.tsx`: The Main Application Component

If `main.tsx` is the entry door, `App.tsx` is the main hall of your application. It's typically where you'll set up:
*   The overall layout of your site (like headers, footers that appear on all pages).
*   The routing logic that determines which "page" or view to show based on the URL.

For our portfolio, `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\src\\App.tsx` will set up the basic page routing using `react-router-dom`.

```tsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
// We'll create these page components soon!
import Index from "@/pages/Index"; // Our main landing page
import NotFound from "@/pages/NotFound"; // A page to show if the URL doesn't match any route
import "./App.css"; // A place for App-specific styles, if any (often minimal with Tailwind)

function App() {
  return (
    // 1. <Router>: This component from react-router-dom enables client-side routing.
    //    It's often aliased as BrowserRouter and uses the HTML5 history API
    //    to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
    <Router>
      {/* 2. <Routes>: Acts as a container for all your individual <Route> definitions.
             It will look through its children <Route>s and render the first one
             that matches the current URL. */}
      <Routes>
        {/* 3. <Route>: Defines a mapping between a URL path and a React component.
               - `path="/"`: Matches the root URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173/).
               - `element={<Index />}`: When the path matches, render the `Index` component. */}
        <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />

        {/* - `path="*"`: This is a wildcard route. It matches any URL that hasn't
               been matched by previous routes. It's perfect for a "404 Not Found" page.
               - `element={<NotFound />}`: Renders the `NotFound` component. */}
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App; // Makes the App component available for main.tsx to import.
```

**Teacher's Tip:**
*   **Client-Side Routing:** `react-router-dom` allows us to create a Single Page Application (SPA). This means the browser doesn't do a full page reload when you navigate between "pages." Instead, React dynamically swaps out the content, making the experience faster and smoother.
*   **Component Structure:** Notice how `App` is a function component, a standard way to write components in modern React. It returns JSX (JavaScript XML), which looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript that describes your UI.

At this point, if you try to run `npm run dev`, it might complain because we haven't created the `pages/Index.tsx` or `pages/NotFound.tsx` files yet. Don't worry, we'll get to that! The key takeaway here is understanding how `main.tsx` kicks things off and `App.tsx` orchestrates the main views of your application.

Next, we'll dive into styling!

## 6. Styling Foundation: Global CSS and Utilities

With our core structure in place, let's talk about styling. A consistent and well-organized styling approach is vital for a professional-looking portfolio.

### Global CSS: `src/index.css`

We've already touched upon `src/index.css` when setting up Tailwind CSS. This file is the main stylesheet for your entire application. It's where Tailwind's directives are included, and it's also the perfect place for defining global styles and CSS custom properties (variables) that Shadcn/ui and your custom components will use.

Let's revisit the key parts of `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\src\\index.css`:

```css
/* 1. Tailwind Directives */

    @apply border-border;
  }

    @apply bg-background text-foreground;
    /* Improves font rendering, especially ligatures and kerning. */
    font-feature-settings: "rlig" 1, "calt" 1;
  }
}
```

**Teacher's Tip:**
*   **CSS Custom Properties (Variables):** Using variables like `--background` or `--primary` is incredibly powerful for theming. Shadcn/ui components are built to use these. If you want to change your site's primary color, you just change the `--primary` variable, and all components update automatically! This is especially useful for implementing dark mode.
*   **`@layer` Directive:** Tailwind processes styles in layers: `base`, `components`, and `utilities`. Using `@layer base` for your global styles and variables ensures they are correctly ordered and can be overridden by Tailwind's utility classes if needed. For example, you might set a global paragraph color in `@layer base`, but then override it for a specific paragraph with a utility class like `text-red-500`.
*   **Dark Mode:** The `.dark` class is the key. We'll later add JavaScript to toggle this class on the `<html>` element, instantly switching between light and dark themes defined by our CSS variables.

### Utility Functions: `src/lib/utils.ts`

When working with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui, you'll often need to conditionally apply classes or merge class names. Shadcn/ui provides a utility function, typically named `cn`, for this purpose. It's usually placed in a `src/lib/utils.ts` file.

If you ran `npx shadcn-ui@latest init` and selected to use utility functions, it should have created this file for you. If not, let's create `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\src\\lib\\utils.ts`:

```typescript
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

// This function is a combination of clsx and tailwind-merge.
// - clsx: A tiny utility for constructing className strings conditionally.
//   (e.g., cn("base-class", { "active-class": isActive }, anotherVariableClass))
// - tailwind-merge: A utility that intelligently merges Tailwind CSS classes in JavaScript
//   without style conflicts. (e.g., merging "p-4 bg-red-500" and "p-2 bg-blue-500"
//   correctly results in "p-2 bg-blue-500" if p-2 overrides p-4, etc.)
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}

// You might add other utility functions here as your project grows.
// For example, formatting dates, currency, etc.
```

**How `cn` is used:**
Imagine you have a component that needs a base set of classes but also some conditional classes:

```tsx
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"; // Assuming your path alias is set up

interface MyButtonProps {
  isActive: boolean;
  variant: "primary" | "secondary";
}

function MyButton({ isActive, variant }: MyButtonProps) {
  const buttonClasses = cn(
    "font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded", // Base classes
    {
      "bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white": variant === "primary",
      "bg-gray-500 hover:bg-gray-700 text-white": variant === "secondary",
      "ring-2 ring-offset-2 ring-blue-500": isActive, // Conditional class for active state
    },
    "transition-colors duration-150" // More base classes
  );

  return <button className={buttonClasses}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

**Teacher's Tip:**
*   The `cn` function is a small but mighty tool. It makes managing complex sets of Tailwind classes in your components much cleaner and less error-prone. `tailwind-merge` is particularly clever because it understands Tailwind's class system and resolves conflicts (e.g., `px-2` and `px-4` together will result in `px-4` if `px-4` is defined later or has higher specificity in the context of how `tailwind-merge` works).
*   The `lib` folder (short for library) is a common convention for utility functions, helper modules, or any code that isn't a React component or a page.

With our global styles set up and the `cn` utility ready, we have a solid foundation for building consistently styled components. Next, we'll start looking at how to bring in and use pre-built UI blocks from Shadcn/ui.

## 7. Building UI Blocks: Shadcn/ui Components

One of the fastest ways to build a beautiful and functional UI is by leveraging a component library. For this project, we're using **Shadcn/ui**. What makes Shadcn/ui unique is that it's not a traditional component library you install as a single package. Instead, you use its Command Line Interface (CLI) tool to pick and add individual components directly into your project source code. This gives you full control over the code, styling, and behavior of each component.

**Key Advantages of Shadcn/ui:**
*   **You Own the Code:** Components are added to your `/src/components/ui` directory. You can modify them as much as you need.
*   **Styled with Tailwind CSS:** Components are designed to be styled with Tailwind CSS and use the CSS variables we defined in `src/index.css` for theming (colors, border radius, etc.).
*   **Accessible:** Built on top of Radix UI primitives, which are designed with accessibility (a11y) in mind.
*   **Composable:** You get the building blocks, so you can easily combine and customize them.

### Setting Up the `ui` Directory

When you add your first Shadcn/ui component using its CLI, it will typically create a `src/components/ui` directory if it doesn't exist. This is where all the Shadcn/ui components you choose will reside.

### Adding a Shadcn/ui Component (Example: Button)

Let's walk through how you would add a `Button` component. This is a hypothetical example, as our actual project might use buttons implicitly through other components or define custom ones if needed, but the process is the same for any Shadcn/ui component (like `Card`, `Dialog`, `Input`, etc.).

1.  **Open Your Terminal:** Make sure you are in the `frontend` directory (`c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend`).

2.  **Run the Shadcn/ui CLI Command:**
    To add the button component, you would run:
    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
    ```

3.  **CLI Prompts:**
    The CLI might ask you a few questions if it's the first time or if your `components.json` is missing some info. Since we already configured `components.json`, it should proceed smoothly.

4.  **What Happens Next?**
    *   A new file, typically `button.tsx`, will be created inside `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\src\\components\\ui\\
    *   This file contains the React and TypeScript code for the `Button` component.
    *   The component will be styled using Tailwind CSS classes and will often use the `cn` utility from `src/lib/utils.ts` for flexible class name management.
    *   It will also use the CSS variables (e.g., `--primary`, `--radius`) from your `src/index.css` for its appearance.

### Using a Shadcn/ui Component

Once the `Button` component is in your project (e.g., at `src/components/ui/button.tsx`), you can import and use it like any other React component:

```tsx
// Example: In one of your page components (e.g., src/pages/Index.tsx)
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"; // Using the path alias

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
      <Button 
        variant="primary" // Shadcn/ui components often have variants
        size="lg"        // And sizes
        onClick={() => alert("Button clicked!")}
      >
        Click Me
      </Button>

      <Button variant="secondary" className="mt-4"> {/* You can still add custom Tailwind classes */}
        Another Button
      </Button>

      <Button variant="destructive">
        Delete
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyPage;
```

**Teacher's Tip:**
*   **Explore the Component Code:** Since the component code is now part of your project, open `src/components/ui/button.tsx` (or whatever component you add). See how it's built! This is a fantastic way to learn how to create flexible and well-structured React components with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Customization:** Don't like something about the default Shadcn/ui component? Change it! You have the source code. You can adjust the default styles, add new variants, or modify its behavior.
*   **`components.json` is Key:** The `components.json` file in your `frontend` directory guides the Shadcn/ui CLI. It tells the CLI where to put components, how to handle TypeScript/JavaScript, your Tailwind configuration, and your path aliases. If you move files around or change your Tailwind config, make sure `components.json` is updated.

### Components Used in "brigati-photo-replica"

For the "brigati-photo-replica" project, we'll likely use several Shadcn/ui components, or components inspired by its patterns, to build our UI. These might include:

*   **Card:** For displaying project information, experience details, and profile sections.
*   **Button:** For interactive elements like "View Resume" or theme toggles.
*   **Avatar:** For profile pictures.
*   **Tabs:** Potentially for filtering projects or sections.
*   **Dialog/Popover:** For modal views or information pop-ups.
*   **Separator:** For visual divisions between sections.

We will either add these directly using `npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>` or create custom components that follow similar design principles and leverage our Tailwind CSS setup and CSS variables.

The beauty of Shadcn/ui is its flexibility. It gives us high-quality, accessible building blocks that we can then tailor to the specific needs of our portfolio.

Next, we'll discuss crafting our own custom components, which will form the unique parts of our portfolio.

## 8. Crafting Custom Components: The Heart of Our Portfolio

While Shadcn/ui provides excellent general-purpose UI building blocks, the true personality and unique structure of our portfolio will come from our own custom React components. These are components we'll build from scratch (or by composing Shadcn/ui components) to perfectly fit the design and functionality of the "brigati-photo-replica" project.

**Where will they live?**
It's a common convention to place your custom, application-specific components in a directory like `src/components`. If a component is only used by a specific page, it might sometimes live in a `components` subdirectory within that page's folder (e.g., `src/pages/HomePage/components/WelcomeBanner.tsx`). For this project, most of our reusable custom components will reside in `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\src\\components\\`.

Let's outline the key custom components we'll need to build for our portfolio, based on the structure seen in `Index.tsx` and typical portfolio elements:

1.  **`Header.tsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** Displays the main navigation for the site. In the replica, this includes the user's name/logo and potentially navigation tabs or links (like "All", "Terraform Labs", etc., for filtering projects).
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Site title or logo.
        *   Navigation links/tabs.
        *   May handle active states for tabs.
        *   Responsive design for different screen sizes.
    *   **Potential Shadcn/ui usage:** Could use `NavigationMenu` for complex navigation, or simple `Button` components styled as tabs.

2.  **`ProfileSection.tsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** Displays the user's main profile information.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Avatar/Profile picture (perhaps using Shadcn/ui `Avatar`).
        *   User's name and title (e.g., "Web Developer & UI Designer").
        *   A brief bio or tagline.
        *   Social media links (e.g., GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter) using icons (e.g., from `lucide-react`).
    *   **Potential Shadcn/ui usage:** `Card` for structure, `Avatar` for the image.

3.  **`LocationAndTechSection.tsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** Shows the user's location and key technologies/skills.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Location information (e.g., "Based in Vancouver, BC").
        *   A list or grid of technologies/skills (e.g., React, TypeScript, Figma, SCSS).
        *   Could use icons for technologies.
    *   **Potential Shadcn/ui usage:** `Card` for structure, `Badge` for displaying individual technologies.

4.  **`ExperienceCard.tsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** A reusable component to display a single work experience item.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Role/Job Title.
        *   Company Name.
        *   Employment Period (e.g., "2019 - 2022").
        *   Type (e.g., "current", "past") - this might influence styling.
    *   **Data Props:** Will receive `role`, `company`, `period`, `type` as props.
    *   **Potential Shadcn/ui usage:** Could be a custom-styled `div` or part of a larger `Card` in `ResumeAndExperienceSection`.

5.  **`ResumeAndExperienceSection.tsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** Displays a link to the resume and lists past work experiences.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   A prominent "RESUME" card/button, possibly with an icon, linking to the resume PDF or a resume page.
        *   A section for "EXPERIENCE," which will map over an array of experience data and render an `ExperienceCard` for each.
        *   May include a small theme toggle UI element as seen in the replica.
    *   **Data Props:** Will receive an array of `experiences` objects.
    *   **Potential Shadcn/ui usage:** `Card` for the resume link, `Button` for the theme toggle.

6.  **`ProjectCard.tsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** A reusable component to display a single project in the portfolio.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Project Image.
        *   Project Title.
        *   Brief Description or Category (e.g., "Design System", "Frontend").
        *   Tags/Technologies used (e.g., "TypeScript", "React", "NextJS").
        *   Company/Client Name (if applicable).
    *   **Data Props:** Will receive `id`, `title`, `description`, `tags`, `image`, `company` as props.
    *   **Potential Shadcn/ui usage:** `Card` is a natural fit here.

7.  **`ProjectsGrid.tsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** Displays a collection of `ProjectCard` components in a responsive grid.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Takes an array of project data as a prop.
        *   Maps over the project data to render multiple `ProjectCard` instances.
        *   Handles the grid layout (e.g., using Tailwind CSS grid classes).
    *   **Data Props:** Will receive an array of `projects` objects.

8.  **`BackgroundAnimation.tsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** Creates the subtle animated background elements seen in the replica (e.g., floating shapes or gradients).
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Likely uses CSS animations or a library like `framer-motion`.
        *   Positioned behind other content.
    *   **Implementation Detail:** This might involve absolutely positioned `div` elements with animations applied.

9.  **`ThemeToggle.tsx` (Implicit or Explicit)**
    *   **Purpose:** Allows the user to switch between light and dark themes.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   A button or switch UI.
        *   JavaScript logic to toggle a `.dark` class on the `<html>` or `<body>` element.
        *   Logic to save the user's preference (e.g., in `localStorage`).
    *   **Location:** This might be part of the `Header` or `ResumeAndExperienceSection` as seen in some designs, or a standalone component.
    *   **Potential Shadcn/ui usage:** `Switch` or a custom-styled `Button` with an icon.

**General Approach to Building Custom Components:**
For each component:
1.  **Create the File:** E.g., `touch src/components/ProfileSection.tsx`.
2.  **Define Props (TypeScript):** If the component needs to receive data, define an `interface` or `type` for its props.
    ```typescript
    // Example for ExperienceCard.tsx
    interface ExperienceCardProps {
      role: string;
      company: string;
      period: string;
      type: 'current' | 'past';
    }

    const ExperienceCard: React.FC<ExperienceCardProps> = ({ role, company, period, type }) => {
      // ... component JSX ...
    };
    ```
3.  **Write JSX Markup:** Structure the component using HTML-like JSX. Apply Tailwind CSS classes for styling directly.
4.  **Add Logic:** Implement any JavaScript/TypeScript logic needed for interactivity, data transformation, etc.
5.  **Style with Tailwind CSS:** Use utility classes extensively. Leverage the `cn` function for conditional or complex class combinations.
6.  **Import and Use:** Import the custom component into parent components or pages where it’s needed.

**Teacher's Tip:**
*   **Component Reusability:** Think about which parts of your UI are repeated. These are good candidates for custom components. For example, if each project is displayed in the same way, create a `ProjectCard` component instead of repeating the JSX everywhere.
*   **Props for Data:** Pass data down to components via props. This makes components flexible and reusable with different content.
*   **Keep Components Focused:** Aim for components that do one thing well. If a component becomes too large or complex, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable sub-components.
*   **Start Simple:** Don't try to build everything at once. Start with the basic structure and styling, then add more complex features or states.

Building these custom components will be the most creative part of the project. By combining them with Shadcn/ui components and our robust styling foundation, we'll be able to construct the full portfolio interface.

Next, we'll look at how these components come together to form our main pages.

## 9. Assembling Pages: Bringing It All Together (`Index.tsx`, `NotFound.tsx`)

With our custom components and Shadcn/ui blocks ready, it's time to assemble them into actual pages that users will navigate. In our `App.tsx`, we defined routes for two main pages:

*   `src/pages/Index.tsx`: The main landing page of our portfolio.
*   `src/pages/NotFound.tsx`: A fallback page for any URLs that don't match in `App.tsx`. It's good practice to have a user-friendly 404 page.

Create `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\src\\pages\\NotFound.tsx`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'; // To link back to the homepage
// You might want to use a Button from Shadcn/ui here
// import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"; 

const NotFound: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-br from-red-100 via-orange-50 to-yellow-100 p-6 text-center">
      <h1 className="text-6xl lg:text-9xl font-bold text-red-600 mb-4">404</h1>
      <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-4xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-6">
        Oops! Page Not Found
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
        The page you are looking for might have been removed, had its name changed,
        or is temporarily unavailable.
      </p>
      <Link to="/">
        {/* Example using a simple link, can be replaced with Shadcn/ui Button */}
        <button 
          className="px-6 py-3 bg-blue-600 text-white font-semibold rounded-lg shadow-md hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors duration-150"
        >
          Go Back to Homepage
        </button>
      </Link>
      {/* 
        // Example with Shadcn/ui Button (if you've added it):
        <Button asChild size="lg">
          <Link to="/">Go Back to Homepage</Link>
        </Button> 
      */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default NotFound;
```

**Teacher's Tip for `NotFound.tsx`:**
*   **User Experience:** A good 404 page reassures the user and provides a way back to familiar territory (like the homepage).
*   **Styling:** Even error pages deserve some style! Make it visually consistent with the rest of your site if possible.
*   **`Link` Component:** Use the `Link` component from `react-router-dom` for internal navigation. This ensures client-side routing without a full page reload.

With `Index.tsx` and `NotFound.tsx` created and populated, the core pages of our application are now defined. The `App.tsx` file can successfully route to these pages. If you had previously created placeholder files for these, replace their content with the above.

If all your custom components (`Header`, `ProfileSection`, etc.) and Shadcn/ui components are also created (even if just as basic skeletons for now), you should be able to run `npm run dev` and see your main page structure start to take shape!

Next, we'll briefly touch upon how `react-router-dom` was set up, although we already did this in `App.tsx`.

## 10. Navigation: Setting Up React Router

We've already integrated `react-router-dom` in our `src/App.tsx` file, which is the heart of our application's navigation. This section serves as a quick review and reinforcement of how it works.

**What is React Router?**
React Router is the de facto standard routing library for React. It allows you to build a Single Page Application (SPA) with navigation, meaning the page doesn't fully reload when the user clicks a link. Instead, React Router dynamically swaps out components on the page, leading to a faster and smoother user experience.

**Key Components Used:**
1.  **`<BrowserRouter>` (aliased as `<Router>` in our `App.tsx`):**
    *   This component should be at the root of your component tree where you want routing to be enabled.
    *   It uses the HTML5 History API (pushState, replaceState, and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
    *   You typically wrap your main `<App>` component or its contents with `<BrowserRouter>`.

2.  **`<Routes>`:**
    *   This component is a container for all your individual route definitions.
    *   It intelligently looks through its child `<Route>` elements and renders the UI of the *first* one that matches the current URL.

3.  **`<Route>`:**
    *   This is where you define the mapping between a URL path and the React component that should be rendered for that path.
    *   **`path` prop:** A string that defines the URL path to match (e.g., `"/"`, `"/about"`, `"/projects/:projectId"`).
    *   **`element` prop:** The React element (component instance) to render when the path matches (e.g., `<Index />`, `<AboutPage />`).

**Our Setup in `src/App.tsx` (Recap):**

```tsx
// c:\Users\PC\Desktop\test_portfolio\frontend\src\App.tsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Index from "@/pages/Index"; // Our main landing page
import NotFound from "@/pages/NotFound"; // Our 404 page
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>  {/* 1. BrowserRouter enables routing */}
      <Routes> {/* 2. Container for all routes */}
        {/* 3. Individual route definitions */}
        <Route path="/" element={<Index />} /> 
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} /> {/* Wildcard for 404 */} 
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**How it Works:**
*   When a user visits `http://yourdomain.com/`, the `path="/"` matches, and the `<Index />` component (our main portfolio page) is rendered.
*   If a user visits `http://yourdomain.com/some/nonexistent/page`, no specific route matches it first. The `path="*"` acts as a catch-all, so the `<NotFound />` component is rendered.

**`<Link>` Component for Navigation:**

To navigate between these routes within your application (e.g., clicking a navigation link in your `Header` or a button to go to the homepage), you should use the `<Link>` component provided by `react-router-dom`.

**Example (inside a component like `Header.tsx` or `NotFound.tsx`):**

```tsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyHeader() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      {/* <Link to="/about">About</Link> */}
      {/* <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link> */}
    </nav>
  );
}
```

**Why use `<Link>` instead of `<a>`?**
*   Using a standard `<a href="...">` tag for internal navigation would cause a full page reload, defeating the purpose of a SPA.
*   The `<Link to="...">` component intercepts the navigation, updates the URL in the browser bar using the History API, and then signals to React Router to render the appropriate component based on the new URL, all without a page refresh.

**Teacher's Tip:**
*   **Dynamic Routes:** React Router also supports dynamic routes, like `path="/users/:userId"`. The `:userId` part is a URL parameter that can be accessed within the routed component. This is useful for showing detail pages for specific items (e.g., a specific project if you had individual project pages).
*   **Nested Routes:** You can also create nested routes for more complex layouts, where parts of the UI remain static while other parts change based on the URL.
*   **Programmatic Navigation:** React Router provides hooks like `useNavigate` that allow you to navigate programmatically (e.g., after a form submission or some other event).

Our current project has a simple routing setup, but `react-router-dom` is capable of handling much more complex scenarios. Understanding these basics is crucial for building navigable React applications.

Next, we'll discuss adding static assets like images and icons to our project.

## 11. Adding Static Assets: Images and Icons

Static assets are files like images, icons, fonts, or JSON data files that are part of your application but don't change dynamically through code (or change very infrequently). In a Vite project, the primary way to handle these is by using the `public` directory.

**The `public` Directory**

*   **Location:** In your `frontend` project, there should be a `public` directory at `c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\public\\`.
*   **Purpose:** Any files placed in the `public` directory are served at the root path (`/`) by Vite's development server and are copied to the root of the `dist` directory during the build process, with their directory structure preserved.

**How to Use It:**

1.  **Place Your Assets:**
    For the "brigati-photo-replica" project, you'll have project images. You should create a structure within `public` to organize them. For example:
    ```
    frontend/
    └── public/
        ├── assets/
        │   └── images/
        │       ├── project1.png
        │       ├── project2.png
        │       ├── profile-picture.jpg
        │       └── some-icon.svg
        └── vite.svg (example asset often included by Vite)
    ```

2.  **Reference Them in Your Code:**
    When you reference these assets in your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript/TypeScript code, you use an **absolute public path** starting with `/`.

    *   **In JSX (e.g., an `<img>` tag in a React component):**
        ```tsx
        // Assuming project1.png is in public/assets/images/project1.png
        <img src="/assets/images/project1.png" alt="Description of Project 1" />

        // Assuming profile-picture.jpg is in public/assets/images/profile-picture.jpg
        <img src="/assets/images/profile-picture.jpg" alt="My Profile Picture" />
        ```
        This is how the `image` paths in your `projects` data in `Index.tsx` should be structured:
        `image: "/assets/images/project1.png"`

    *   **In CSS (e.g., a `background-image`):**
        ```css
        .my-element {
          background-image: url('/assets/images/some-background.jpg');
        }
        ```

    *   **In `index.html`:**
        The `favicon.ico` or other root-level assets are often referenced here.
        ```html
        <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />
        ```

**Why use the `public` directory this way?**
*   **Simplicity:** It's straightforward. Vite handles serving these files directly.
*   **No Processing:** Files in `public` are not processed by Vite's build pipeline. They are copied as-is. This is good for assets that don't need optimization or hashing (though Vite does offer ways to import assets into the JS bundle for hashing if needed, which is a more advanced topic).
*   **Predictable Paths:** The paths are always absolute from the root, making them easy to manage.

**Icons (e.g., `lucide-react`)**

For icons, we've installed `lucide-react`. This is a library of SVG icons that you import as React components. This is different from placing SVG files in the `public` directory.

**How to use `lucide-react`:**

1.  **Import the Icon:**
    In your React component file (e.g., `ProfileSection.tsx` for social media icons):
    ```tsx
    import { Github, Linkedin, Twitter } from 'lucide-react';
    ```

2.  **Use as a Component:**
    ```tsx
    function ProfileSection() {
      return (
        <div>
          {/* ... other profile info ... */}
          <a href="https://github.com/yourusername" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            <Github color="black" size={24} /> {/* You can pass props like color, size, strokeWidth */}
          </a>
          <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            <Linkedin color="#0077B5" size={24} />
          </a>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

**Teacher's Tip:**
*   **Organize `public`:** Keep your `public` directory tidy. Use subfolders like `images`, `fonts`, `data` to categorize your assets.
*   **Image Optimization:** While Vite doesn't process files in `public` by default, for a production website, you should ensure your images are optimized for the web (e.g., compressed, correctly sized). You can do this manually before placing them in `public`, or explore Vite plugins for image optimization if you want an automated workflow (though this adds complexity).
*   **When *not* to use `public`:** If an asset is tightly coupled with a specific component and you want it to be part of Vite's module graph (e.g., for hashing, or if it's a small SVG you want to inline as a component), you can import it directly into your JavaScript/TypeScript. Vite handles these imports differently. For most general static assets like project showcase images, `public` is the way to go.
    ```tsx
    // Example of importing an image into the JS bundle (alternative to /public)
    // import myImageSource from './assets/my-specific-image.png'; // Path relative to the JS file
    // <img src={myImageSource} alt="..." />
    ```
    For this project, sticking to the `public` directory for images as described in `Index.tsx` is perfectly fine and recommended for simplicity.

Make sure to create the `frontend/public/assets/images/` path and populate it with the placeholder images (or your actual project images) that are referenced in your `projects` data in `Index.tsx`.

Next, we'll cover how to run your development server and build the project for production.

## 12. Running and Building: Seeing Your Creation

Alright, you've configured your project, written components, assembled pages, and handled assets. Now it's time to see your creation in action and learn how to prepare it for deployment!

**Running the Development Server**

Vite comes with a highly optimized development server that provides features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR), meaning changes you make to your code are reflected in the browser almost instantly without a full page reload.

1.  **Navigate to Your Project:**
    Open your terminal and make sure you are in the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd c:\Users\PC\Desktop\test_portfolio\frontend
    ```

2.  **Run the `dev` Script:**
    In your `package.json`, Vite set up a `dev` script. To start the development server, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Or, if you prefer using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

3.  **Access Your Application:**
    Once the server starts, it will typically print a local URL to the console, usually `http://localhost:5173/` (Vite's default) or `http://localhost:8080/` if you configured it like in our `vite.config.ts` example.
    Open this URL in your web browser.

    You should now see your portfolio website! As you make changes to your `.tsx` or `.css` files, the browser should update automatically.

**Teacher's Tip (Development Server):**
*   **Console Output:** Keep an eye on the terminal where `npm run dev` is running. It will show you compilation status, any errors or warnings from Vite, TypeScript, or ESLint.
*   **Browser DevTools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually F12) extensively. The Console tab will show client-side JavaScript errors and `console.log` messages. The Elements tab lets you inspect the HTML and CSS. The Network tab shows assets being loaded.
*   **Port Conflicts:** If port `5173` (or your configured port) is already in use, Vite will usually try the next available port. The terminal output will always tell you the correct URL.

**Building for Production**

When you're ready to deploy your website so others can see it, you need to create a production build. This process optimizes your code (minification, tree-shaking, bundling) to make it as small and efficient as possible for users.

1.  **Run the `build` Script:**
    Your `package.json` also has a `build` script:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    Or with Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

2.  **The `dist` Directory:**
    Vite will perform the build process and output the optimized static files into a directory named `dist` within your `frontend` folder (`c:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\test_portfolio\\frontend\\dist\\`).

    The contents of this `dist` directory are what you will deploy to your hosting provider. It will typically contain:
    *   `index.html`: The main entry point.
    *   `assets/`: A folder containing your JavaScript bundles (with hashed filenames for caching), CSS files, and any images or other assets that were part of the build process (this is different from the `public` folder assets, which are copied as-is).

**Previewing the Production Build Locally (Optional)**

Vite provides a command to serve your `dist` folder locally, so you can check if the production build works as expected before deploying it.

1.  **Run the `preview` Script:**
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```
    Or with Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn preview
    ```
2.  **Access the Preview:**
    This will start a simple static web server. The terminal will give you a URL (often `http://localhost:4173/`) to preview the production build.

**Teacher's Tip (Production Build):**
*   **Environment Variables:** Vite supports environment variables. You might have different API keys or settings for development versus production. These are typically managed through `.env` files (e.g., `.env.production`).
*   **Build Size:** Pay attention to the size of your production bundles. Large bundles can lead to slow load times. Tools like `source-map-explorer` can help you analyze what's contributing to your bundle size if it becomes an issue.
*   **Testing the Build:** Always test your production build locally using `npm run preview` before deploying, especially if you have environment-specific configurations.

With these commands, you can develop your portfolio efficiently and prepare it for the world to see!

Next, we'll discuss some common options for deploying your shiny new portfolio.
